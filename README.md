- 👋 Hi, I’m @robertshepherdcpp. i am a c++ expert.
- 👀 I’m extremely interested in c++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my repositories or other peoples libraries.
- 📫 How to reach me robertcppshepherd@gmail.com.

I am a self taught developer! I am very intersted in c++, as I mentioned above. I mainly contribute to my own libraries, like `pse` which is just a general purpose library like the c++ standard libarary. I try to contribute to something everyday! I also want to contribute more to SerenityOS becuase it looks so cool. I would class myself as a c++ expert. You can find me on stackoverlow. I am willing to contribute to anything c++!

Repositories | How often i contribute | My current issues with them  | Link
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------
👩‍💻 pse | ✅ At least 5 commits a day | ⭕️ Lots of the files have bugs | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/pse
👩‍💻 files | ✅ I dont really add anything more to them | ⭕️ Not really many issues as they are only small programs | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/files
👩‍💻 SerenityOS | ✅ I try to get familiar with the codebase at least every other day | ⭕️ It is a big codebase in SerenityOS! | 🔗 https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity
👩‍💻 Decomp | ✅ I don't contribute to it any more | ⭕️ It wasn't really much of a repository and it is very error prone! | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/Decomp

Those are some of my repos, The one i am predominantly working on now is the `pse` library.
