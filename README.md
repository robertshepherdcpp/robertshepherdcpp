- 👋 Hi, I’m @robertshepherdcpp. i am a c++ expert.
- 👀 I’m extremely interested in c++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my repositories or other peoples libraries.
- 📫 How to reach me robertcppshepherd@gmail.com.

I am very intersted in c++, as I mentioned above. I mainly contribute to my own libraries, like `pse` which is just a general purpose library like the c++ standard libarary. I try to contribute to something everyday! I also want to contribute more to SerenityOS becuase it looks so cool. I would class myself as a c++ expert. You can find me on stackoverlow. I am willing to contribute to anything c++!
