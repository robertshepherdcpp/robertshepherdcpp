- 👋 Hi, I’m @robertshepherdcpp.
- 👀 I’m extremely interested in c++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my repositories or other peoples libraries.
- 📫 How to reach me robertcppshepherd@gmail.com.

I am a self taught developer! I am very intersted in c++, as I mentioned above. I mainly contribute to my own libraries, like `mlib` which a very cool, simple and fast template metaprogramming library. I try to contribute to something everyday! I am willing to contribute to anything c++! Here is my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-r1dgQjj2ggCQJWbhyn2NFpnHcSyzuIE-Dd8PPwPCs/edit?usp=sharing), as I am looking for some part time work. Please email me if you are interseted in hiring me.

Repositories | How often i contribute | My current issues with them  | Link
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------
👩‍💻 pse | ✅ I don't contribute anymore | ⭕️ Lots of the files have bugs | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/pse
👩‍💻 files | ✅ I dont really add anything more to them | ⭕️ Not really many issues as they are only small programs | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/files
👩‍💻 Decomp | ✅ I don't contribute to it any more | ⭕️ It wasn't really much of a repository and it is very error prone! | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/Decomp
👩‍💻 format | ✅ I don't contribute to it any more | ⭕️ I have had it a while and I just thought I would put it on github, it doesn't need anything more added to it as it is just supposed to be a really basic tool. | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/format
👩‍💻 ont | ✅ Contribute occasionally | ⭕️ It is like herb sutters cpp2 syntax in that it converts code into c++ code and then you run it. Herb Sutter's cpp2 is a lot more developed than my ont! | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/ont
👩‍💻 mlib | ✅ Contribute quite regularly | ⭕️ It is just like a normal c++ meta-programming library that you would find. | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/mlib

Those are some of my repos/ones I want to contribute to, The one I am predominantly working on now is the `mlib` library.
