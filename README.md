- 👋 Hi, I’m @robertshepherdcpp.
- 👀 I’m extremely interested in c++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my repositories or other people's repositories.
- 📫 How to reach me robertcppshepherd@gmail.com.
- 💬 Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/robertshepherdcpp/issues).

I am a young self taught developer! I am very interested in c++, as I mentioned above. I mainly contribute to my own libraries, like `mlib` which a very cool, simple and fast metaprogramming library. I try to contribute to something everyday! I am willing to contribute to anything C++! I am looking for some part time work, here is my [resume](https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/robertshepherdcpp/blob/main/Resume%20(3).pdf). Please [email](rshepherdcpp@gmail.com) me if you are interested in hiring me. You can also hire me on [fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/rshepherdcpp/program-anything-in-cpp-for-you).

Repositories | How often i contribute | My current issues with them  | Link
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------
👨‍💻 pse | ✅ I don't contribute anymore | ⭕️ There are a few bugs in pse | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/pse
👨‍💻 files | ✅ I dont add anything more to them | ⭕️ Not really many issues as they are only small programs | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/files
👨‍💻 Decomp | ✅ I don't contribute to it any more | ⭕️ It wasn't really much of a repository and it is very error prone! | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/Decomp
👨‍💻 format | ✅ I don't contribute to it any more | ⭕️ I have had it a while and I just thought I would put it on github, it doesn't need anything more added to it as it is just supposed to be a really basic tool. | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/format
👨‍💻 ont | ✅ Contribute very occasionally | ⭕️ It is like herb sutters cpp2 syntax in that it converts code into c++ code and then you run it. Herb Sutter's cpp2 is a lot more developed than my ont! | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/ont
👨‍💻 mlib | ✅ Contribute quite regularly | ⭕️ It is just like a normal c++ meta-programming library that you would find, but with some extra cool features. | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/mlib
👨‍💻 sfml-chess | ✅ Contribute quite regularly | ⭕️ An app on which you can play chess, the issue is that it is not completed yet. | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/sfml-chess
👨‍💻 flashcard-app | ✅ Dont contribute any more | ⭕️ An app that you can use and make flashcards | 🔗 https://github.com/robertshepherdcpp/flashcard-app

Those are some of my repos/ones I want to contribute to, The one I am predominantly working on now is the `mlib` library.
